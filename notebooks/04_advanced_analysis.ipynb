    "In this notebook, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Density gradients**: Identifying weak layers through density changes with depth\n",
    "2. **Temperature gradients**: Understanding faceting conditions (gradients > 10 K/m indicate weak layer formation)\n",
    "3. **Multi-location comparison**: Comparing statistics across different locations\n",
    "4. **Temporal analysis**: Using rolling averages to smooth time series and calculating rates of change\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gradients**: `ds['variable'].diff(dim='layer')` for layer-to-layer differences\n",
    "- **Temperature gradient**: `temp_diff / z_diff` to get gradient per unit depth\n",
    "- **Rolling windows**: `ds.rolling(time=7).mean()` for smoothing time series\n",
    "- **Rate of change**: `ds.diff(dim='time')` to see how values change over time\n",
    "- **Multi-location stats**: `.mean(dim=['time', 'layer'])` to aggregate across dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
