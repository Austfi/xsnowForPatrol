    "## Part 1: What is xsnow?\n",
    "\n",
    "**xsnow** is a Python library designed to make working with snowpack simulation data efficient and intuitive. It's built specifically for data from the SNOWPACK model (and other snow models), which outputs detailed information about snow layers over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why xsnow?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handles complex file formats**: SNOWPACK outputs come in specialized formats (.pro, .smet) that xsnow can parse automatically\n",
    "- **Organized data structure**: Instead of juggling hundreds of separate files, xsnow organizes everything into a single, coherent dataset\n",
    "- **Powerful analysis tools**: Built-in functions for common snowpack analyses (SWE, weak layers, stability indices)\n",
    "- **Built on proven libraries**: Uses xarray, NumPy, and pandas under the hood, so you get their full power\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Big Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of xsnow as a translator: it takes raw SNOWPACK output files and converts them into a format that's easy to work with in Python. Instead of manually parsing text files, you get a clean, organized dataset where you can ask questions like \"Show me all weak layers on north-facing slopes after February 1st\" with simple code.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. **location**: The site or grid point (e.g., \"VIR1A\", \"Station_1\")\n",
    "2. **time**: When the profile was measured/simulated\n",
    "3. **slope**: Different slope aspects at the same location (north-facing, south-facing, etc.)\n",
    "4. **realization**: Different model runs or scenarios (for ensemble runs)\n",
    "5. **layer**: The vertical layers within the snowpack (layer 0 = surface, higher numbers = deeper)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure allows you to ask powerful questions:\n",
    "- \"Show me density profiles for all locations on February 1st\"\n",
    "- \"Compare north vs south-facing slopes\"\n",
    "- \"Find weak layers across all time steps\"\n",
    "- All without writing loops!\n",

    "\u2705 **What we learned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **xsnow** is a Python library for working with snowpack simulation data\n",
    "2. **Python fundamentals**: NumPy (arrays), pandas (tables), xarray (multi-dimensional labeled arrays)\n",
    "3. **xsnow's data model**: 5 dimensions (location, time, slope, realization, layer)\n",
    "4. **Loading data**: Use `xsnow.read()` to load .pro and .smet files\n",
    "5. **Dataset structure**: xsnowDataset contains dimensions, coordinates, and data variables\n",
    "6. **Two types of variables**: Profile-level (like HS) and layer-level (like density)\n",
    "7. **Metadata**: Check `.attrs` for units and descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts to Remember\n",
    "\n",
    "- **xsnowDataset** = wrapper around xarray Dataset, specialized for snowpack data\n",
    "- **Dimensions** = the axes of your data (location, time, slope, realization, layer)\n",
    "- **Coordinates** = labels for dimensions (station names, dates, etc.)\n",
    "- **Profile-level** = one value per profile (no layer dimension)\n",
    "- **Layer-level** = one value per layer per profile (has layer dimension)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Ready to start working with the data? Move on to:\n",
    "- **02_basic_operations_and_analysis.ipynb**: Learn how to select, filter, and analyze your data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises (Try These!)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load a sample .pro file and print its dimensions\n",
    "2. List all the data variables in your dataset\n",
    "3. Check the units for density and temperature\n",
    "4. Find the time range of your data\n",
    "5. Count how many layers the deepest profile has\n"
