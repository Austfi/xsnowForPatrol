    "## Part 1: What is xsnow?\n",
    "\n",
    "**xsnow** is a Python library designed to make working with snowpack simulation data efficient and intuitive. It's built specifically for data from the SNOWPACK model (and other snow models), which outputs detailed information about snow layers over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why xsnow?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handles complex file formats**: SNOWPACK outputs come in specialized formats (.pro, .smet) that xsnow can parse automatically\n",
    "- **Organized data structure**: Instead of juggling hundreds of separate files, xsnow organizes everything into a single, coherent dataset\n",
    "- **Powerful analysis tools**: Built-in functions for common snowpack analyses (SWE, weak layers, stability indices)\n",
    "- **Built on proven libraries**: Uses xarray, NumPy, and pandas under the hood, so you get their full power\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Big Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of xsnow as a translator: it takes raw SNOWPACK output files and converts them into a format that's easy to work with in Python. Instead of manually parsing text files, you get a clean, organized dataset where you can ask questions like \"Show me all weak layers on north-facing slopes after February 1st\" with simple code.\n"

    "\n",
    "xsnow organizes snowpack data using **5 key dimensions**. This might sound complex, but it's actually very logical once you understand it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 5 Dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **location**: The site or grid point (e.g., \"VIR1A\", \"Station_1\")\n",
    "2. **time**: When the profile was measured/simulated\n",
    "3. **slope**: Different slope aspects at the same location (north-facing, south-facing, etc.)\n",
    "4. **realization**: Different model runs or scenarios (for ensemble runs)\n",
    "5. **layer**: The vertical layers within the snowpack (layer 0 = surface, higher numbers = deeper)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure allows you to ask powerful questions:\n",
    "- \"Show me density profiles for all locations on February 1st\"\n",
    "- \"Compare north vs south-facing slopes\"\n",
    "- \"Find weak layers across all time steps\"\n",
    "- All without writing loops!\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Profile-level**: Properties of the entire snowpack (e.g., total snow height HS). These don't vary by layer.\n",
    "- **Layer-level**: Properties of individual layers (e.g., density, temperature). These vary by layer.\n",
