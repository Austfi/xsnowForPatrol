    "## Part 1: What is xsnow?\n",
    "\n",
    "**xsnow** is a Python library designed to make working with snowpack simulation data efficient and intuitive. It's built specifically for data from the SNOWPACK model (and other snow models), which outputs detailed information about snow layers over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why xsnow?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handles complex file formats**: SNOWPACK outputs come in specialized formats (.pro, .smet) that xsnow can parse automatically\n",
    "- **Organized data structure**: Instead of juggling hundreds of separate files, xsnow organizes everything into a single, coherent dataset\n",
    "- **Powerful analysis tools**: Built-in functions for common snowpack analyses (SWE, weak layers, stability indices)\n",
    "- **Built on proven libraries**: Uses xarray, NumPy, and pandas under the hood, so you get their full power\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Big Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of xsnow as a translator: it takes raw SNOWPACK output files and converts them into a format that's easy to work with in Python. Instead of manually parsing text files, you get a clean, organized dataset where you can ask questions like \"Show me all weak layers on north-facing slopes after February 1st\" with simple code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do we need xsnow?**\n",
    "\n",
    "With xsnow, you get:\n",
    "- Automatic file parsing with `xsnow.read()`\n",
    "- Unified data structure (xsnowDataset) for all your data\n",
    "- Label-based indexing: `ds.sel(location=\"VIR1A\", time=\"2024-02-01\")`\n",
    "- Built-in analysis functions: `ds.compute_swe()`, `ds.find_weak_layers()`\n",
    "- Automatic alignment and broadcasting when combining datasets\n",
    "- Rich metadata preserved from original files\n",
    "- Access to full xarray ecosystem for advanced operations\n"

    "## Part 2: Understanding xsnow's Data Model\n",
    "\n",
    "xsnow organizes snowpack data using **5 key dimensions**. This might sound complex, but it's actually very logical once you understand it.\n"

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "### The 5 Dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **location**: The site or grid point (e.g., \"VIR1A\", \"Station_1\")\n",
    "2. **time**: When the profile was measured/simulated\n",
    "3. **slope**: Different slope aspects at the same location (north-facing, south-facing, etc.)\n",
    "4. **realization**: Different model runs or scenarios (for ensemble runs)\n",
    "5. **layer**: The vertical layers within the snowpack (layer 0 = surface, higher numbers = deeper)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure allows you to ask powerful questions:\n",
    "- \"Show me density profiles for all locations on February 1st\"\n",
    "- \"Compare north vs south-facing slopes\"\n",
    "- \"Find weak layers across all time steps\"\n",
    "- All without writing loops of code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Profile-level vs Layer-level Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Profile-level**: Properties of the entire snowpack (e.g., total snow height HS). These don't vary by layer.\n",
    "- **Layer-level**: Properties of individual layers (e.g., density, temperature). These vary by layer.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Understanding File Formats\n",

    "### Understanding the Dataset Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two Bites Pattern**: Let's understand datasets in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conceptually (First Bite)**: An xsnowDataset is like a smart container that organizes all your snowpack data. It knows about locations, times, layers, and keeps everything connected. Think of it as a multi-dimensional spreadsheet where each \"sheet\" is a different variable (density, temperature, etc.), and the rows/columns are organized by location, time, and depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Technically (Second Bite)**: When you load data with `xsnow.read()`, you get an **xsnowDataset**. This is a special wrapper around an xarray Dataset that's designed for snowpack data. It extends xarray's functionality with snowpack-specific methods and metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's in an xsnowDataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "An xsnowDataset contains several key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dimensions**: The axes of your data (location, time, slope, realization, layer)\n",
    "   - Define the shape and size of your data\n",
    "   - Example: `location: 3, time: 100, layer: 20` means 3 locations, 100 time steps, up to 20 layers\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Coordinates**: Labels for each dimension\n",
    "   - Provide meaningful names/values for each position along a dimension\n",
    "   - Example: location names like \"VIR1A\", time values like \"2024-01-15\", layer indices 0-19\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Variables**: The actual data arrays\n",
    "   - Each variable (density, temperature, etc.) is stored as a DataArray\n",
    "   - Can be profile-level (no layer dimension) or layer-level (has layer dimension)\n",
    "   - Example: `density` has dimensions `(location, time, slope, realization, layer)`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Attributes**: Metadata about variables and the dataset\n",
    "   - Units, descriptions, source information\n",
    "   - Example: `density.attrs['units'] = 'kg/m³'`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Relationship**: `xsnowDataset` is a wrapper around `xarray.Dataset`. This means:\n",
    "- You can use most xarray methods directly: `ds.mean()`, `ds.sel()`, `ds.groupby()`, etc.\n",
    "- xsnow adds snowpack-specific methods and metadata\n",
    "- You can access the underlying xarray Dataset if needed (though usually not necessary)\n",
