    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **What we learned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Selecting data**: `.sel()` for labels, `.isel()` for positions\n",
    "2. **Filtering**: `.where()` with conditions to find specific layers/profiles\n",
    "3. **Aggregations**: `.mean()`, `.max()`, `.min()`, `.sum()` across dimensions\n",
    "4. **SWE calculation**: Sum of density × thickness over layers\n",
    "5. **Weak layer identification**: Using conditions to find problematic layers\n",
    "6. **Time series**: Analyzing changes over time with `.diff()`, `.mean()`, etc.\n",
    "7. **NumPy integration**: `.values` to get raw arrays when needed\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Operations Cheat Sheet\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Selection\n",
    "ds.sel(location=\"VIR1A\", time=\"2024-02-01\")  # By label\n",
    "ds.isel(time=0, layer=0)                      # By position\n",
    "\n",
    "# Filtering\n",
    "ds.where(ds['density'] > 300, drop=True)      # Condition\n",
    "\n",
    "# Aggregations\n",
    "ds['density'].mean(dim='layer')               # Mean over layers\n",
    "ds['HS'].max(dim='time')                      # Max over time\n",
    "\n",
    "# Time operations\n",
    "ds['HS'].diff(dim='time')                     # Change over time\n",
    "ds.resample(time='1D').mean()                 # Resample\n",

    "# NumPy\n",
    "ds['density'].values                          # Get array\n",

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select data for a specific date and print the density profile\n",
    "2. Find all layers with temperature below -5°C\n",
    "3. Compute the mean density for the top 3 layers across all time steps\n",
    "4. Calculate how much the snow height changed between the first and last time step\n",
    "5. Identify profiles that have at least one layer with density < 100 kg/m³\n"
